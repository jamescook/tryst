    # menu_bar/context_menu are the two entry points into a menu subtree -
    # everything under them (nested :menu cascades, :menu_item/
    # :menu_separator/:menu_checkbox/:menu_radio entries) is built in one
    # shot by Realizer#create_menu_tree, in menu-add order, rather than
    # through the generic per-node create/link passes every other node type
    # uses - menu entries have no Tk path or geometry-managed arrangement
    # of their own to visit separately, so custom_create: hands the whole
    # thing off (see create_menu_tree's own doc comment for why it also
    # skips #link entirely).
    #
    # tk_command: is documentary only here - create_menu_tree calls the
    # real "menu" Tk command directly, never the generic tk_command_for
    # path custom_create: bypasses. arranged: false since a menu_bar
    # attaches via its parent's own -menu option, not pack/grid.
