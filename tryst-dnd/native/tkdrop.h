/* tkdrop.h - Native file drop target support
 *
 * Cross-platform abstraction for registering Tk widgets as file drop
 * targets. Each platform implements teek_register_drop_target() which
 * hooks into the OS drag-and-drop system and generates <<DropFile>>
 * virtual events.
 *
 * Based on tkdnd (https://github.com/petasis/tkdnd) as protocol
 * reference. MIT license, matching the rest of this project.
